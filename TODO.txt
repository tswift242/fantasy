Revisions/Refactoring:
-- make classes as immutable as possible
***** make some local variables/arguments final?
-- put IllegalArgumentException checking in Player.java to avoid code repetition?
-- make categoriesToString() static
-- make evaluate() use fixed # args instead of var # args
-- work on cmd line interface?
***** cmd line flags

New features:
-- Metrics
-- Get player stats from online source (e.g. nfl.com)
-- GUI?
***** tabs/radio button for position (include all as option)
***** side-by-side grids, each with own edit boxes for scoring coeffs within each tab
***** default scoring coeffs from nfl.com; button to revert to default coeffs
***** capability to remember smallest/largest metric value (display min/max/mean?)
***** solve for best coeffs based on some reference player rankings
***** option to update player data/choose stats year?
