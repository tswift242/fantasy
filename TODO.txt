Revisions/Refactoring:
***-- create separate listeners package
*****-- sort players in PlayersPanel by score on an evaluation
-- comment out Modes.ALL??
--seperate Jpanel constructors into multiple helper methods (consult Java examples, e.g. TabDemo.java)

--Model: look into creating separate package which encapsulates things like players list so that duplication is less apparent. ***Look into using only one list of players by modifying Player.java
	************-- make Player have map of RulesMap -> score; need way to specify which one is active --> active RulesMap field?

-- look into computing entire RuleMap in one call of parseScoringRules()
*******-- rename football/ to customerscorer/??

**** call static method of generic type
**** reuse abstract method code
-- avoid code repetition in argument validation in Player subclasses
-- avoid code repetition in field code in Player subclasses (keep first field in subclasses and put methods for all other fields in Player?)
-- make categoriesToString() static
-- get rid of getYardsUnit() in categories classes?
-- work on cmd line interface?
***** cmd line flags

New features:
-- Metrics
-- Get player stats from online source (e.g. nfl.com)
-- GUI?
***** use MVC!!!!!
***** tabs/radio button for position (include all as option)
***** side-by-side grids, each with own edit boxes for scoring coeffs within each tab
***** default scoring coeffs from nfl.com; button to revert to default coeffs
***** capability to remember smallest/largest metric value (display min/max/mean?)
***** solve for best coeffs based on some reference player rankings
***** option to update player data/choose stats year?
