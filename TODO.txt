Revisions/Refactoring:


********** modify model.run(): make Object to hold all results, both to return and pass to View, and to give to ResultsLogger
***make sorting more efficient (hard code name -> idx map since TableModel doesn't change)

*******remove warnings
-- extract certain methods to Utils classes
***********create separate method in Model for logging results
-- flag for cmd line vs GUI in main class
-- flag for updating rules in RecalculateScoreListener vs RulesListener (lazy vs eager)
-- use diamond operator with generics

Naming:
--Modes -> Mode
--model.setRuleMap() -> model.setRules()
--*Util -> *Utils

-- create JPanel subclass or Util for repeated grid bag layout code
--seperate Jpanel constructors into multiple helper methods (consult Java examples, e.g. TabDemo.java)

***-- make Player subclasses have List<Set<? extends StatType>>
--Model: look into creating separate package which encapsulates things like players list so that duplication is less apparent. ***Look into using only one list of players by modifying Player.java
	************-- make Player have map of RulesMap -> score; need way to specify which one is active --> active RulesMap field?

-- comment out Modes.ALL??
-- look into computing entire RuleMap in one call of parseScoringRules()
*******-- rename football/ to customerscorer/??




**** call static method of generic type
**** reuse abstract method code
-- avoid code repetition in argument validation in Player subclasses
-- avoid code repetition in field code in Player subclasses (keep first field in subclasses and put methods for all other fields in Player?)
-- make categoriesToString() static
-- get rid of getYardsUnit() in categories classes?
-- work on cmd line interface?
***** cmd line flags

New features:
-- Metrics
-- Get player stats from online source (e.g. nfl.com)
-- GUI?
***** use MVC!!!!!
***** tabs/radio button for position (include all as option)
***** side-by-side grids, each with own edit boxes for scoring coeffs within each tab
***** default scoring coeffs from nfl.com; button to revert to default coeffs
***** capability to remember smallest/largest metric value (display min/max/mean?)
***** solve for best coeffs based on some reference player rankings
***** option to update player data/choose stats year?




***************************************************************************************
Option 1: update Rules using RuleListener each time user types in rule text field

Pros:
--more efficient if user changes only a small number of rules
--work distributed throughout execution, instead of being done all at once (--> avoid potential lag)

Cons:
--need to be able to pass TextFields up through JPanels to View for adding listeners

Notes:


Option 2: update Rules using RecalcScoreListener, only when user his "recalculate score" button

Pros:
--more efficient if user plays around with same rule, or sets many rules

Cons:

Notes:
grab ScorerPanel from JButton in ActionEvent using SwingUtilities.getAncestorOfClass()
