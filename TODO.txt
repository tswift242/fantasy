Revisions/Refactoring:
****** avoid repeated work in parsing coeffs -- get once in main (switch based on mode)
-- look into computing entire RuleMap in one call of parseScoringRules()
-- review error checking

**** call static method of generic type
**** reuse abstract method code
-- avoid code repetition in argument validation in Player subclasses
-- avoid code repetition in field code in Player subclasses (keep first field in subclasses and put methods for all other fields in Player?)
-- make categoriesToString() static
-- get rid of getYardsUnit() in categories classes?
-- work on cmd line interface?
***** cmd line flags

New features:
-- Metrics
-- Get player stats from online source (e.g. nfl.com)
-- GUI?
***** use MVC!!!!!
***** tabs/radio button for position (include all as option)
***** side-by-side grids, each with own edit boxes for scoring coeffs within each tab
***** default scoring coeffs from nfl.com; button to revert to default coeffs
***** capability to remember smallest/largest metric value (display min/max/mean?)
***** solve for best coeffs based on some reference player rankings
***** option to update player data/choose stats year?
